  - Subtract Matricies
  - Transpose Matricies
  - Perform Row reduction to convert matrix into REF (Confirmed working)
  - Can compute determinants (uses REF function)
  - Perform Row reduction to convert matrix into RREF (confirmed working)
  - Can compute inverse matrix (confirmed working)
  - Can make both row and column vectors
  - Can compute dot product of column vectors
  - Can compute cross product of column vectors
  - Can calculate the magnitude of a column vector
  - Can calculate the angle between 2 vectors
  - Can calculate the angle between a vector and the horizontal (only for vectors in R^2)
