# LApy
LApy is a Linear Algebra API for python in which one can perform the many Linear Algebraic operations on matricies and vectors

# What can LApy do now (31 July 2019)
  - Multiply Matricies (Now can use * opperator)
  - Multiply Matricies by a constant (Now can use * opperator)
  - Add Matricies (Now can use + opperator)
  - Subtract Matricies (Now can use - opperator)
  - Transpose Matricies
  - Perform Row reduction to convert matrix into REF (Confirmed working)
  - Can compute determinants (uses REF function)
  - Perform Row reduction to convert matrix into RREF (confirmed working)
  - Can compute inverse matrix (confirmed working) (Now can use ~ opperator)
  - Can make both row and column vectors
  - Can compute dot product of column vectors
  - Can compute cross product of column vectors
  - Can calculate the magnitude of a column vector
  - Can calculate the angle between 2 vectors
  - Can calculate the angle between a vector and the horizontal (only for vectors in R^2)
  - Can calculate eigan values for a 2x2 matrix
  - Can calculate eigan vectors for a 2x2 matrix (NOT TESTED)
  - Can take powers of matricies with ** opperator
